<h2>Introduction</h2>
PC assemble lab activity was conducted on 25th October 2023, at 2.50pm, in Makmal Inovasi (322-02) N28, Level 3A. 5 students were formed in a group by our lecturer Dr Azurah and we started to assemble the CPU. Firstly, we opened the case. Next, we install the CPU processor and cooler. Then we put in the power supply. Next, we put in the RAM. Then, we put in all the cable. Finally, we close the case and we finished assemble the CPU. After that, we connected our CPU to the desktop prepared by lecturer to check that whether the CPU can function or not. Our group CPU can function when connected to the desktop so we ends our lab activity successfully.

<h2>Reflections</h2>
I have learned the complete steps to assemble a computer CPU by completing the lab. I also learned the name of the components inside the CPU. After assemble CPU, my classmate and me also did a quiz to test our knowledge on how to assemble the CPU and the name of the CPU components. My suggestion for the improvement is I hope that we are given more time to complete the quiz. I also hope that we have more time to prepare and study for the quiz
